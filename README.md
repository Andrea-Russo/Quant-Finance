# Quantitative Finance Repository

Welcome to the Quantitative Finance Repository! This repository is dedicated to the exploration and development of programs and experiments in the field of quantitative finance. Here, you'll find a range of resources and codebases aimed at providing insights into financial markets using quantitative analysis.

## What is Quantitative Finance?

Quantitative finance involves the use of mathematical models and computational algorithms to analyze financial markets and securities. It combines the disciplines of finance, mathematics, and computer science to predict market behaviors and develop financial strategies.

## Repository Contents

- **Financial Modeling**: Code samples for different financial models, including options pricing, volatility models, Monte Carlo techniques and more.

## Goals
The goal of this repository is to document my learning of quant finance techniques! I hope you find it intersting
